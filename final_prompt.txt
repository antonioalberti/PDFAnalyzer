You are an expert assistant analyzing a scientific paper for coverage of technological enablers. 

CONTEXT:

The enablers and their associated keywords are as follows:

{enablers_and_keywords}

Below is the frequency count of keywords found in the paper for each enabler category:

{keyword_counts}

Additionally, here are significant paragraphs extracted from the paper that highlight relevant content:

{significant_paragraphs}

TASK: Considering the main objective of each enabler (e.g. support for adequate naming), write no more than three concise paragraphs summarizing how well the contributions identified in the significant paragraphs above cover the objectives proposed in each enablers. Use the enablers description, keyword counts, and the significant paragraphs as input. Use the following criteria:

- Good coverage: more than 10 keywords with counts above 5.
- Small coverage: fewer keywords or counts below threshold.
- No coverage: zero counts.

Please consider the following guidelines when writing your response:
– Vary sentence structure and length to increase dynamism
– Introduce intellectual hesitation (e.g., “might suggest,” “it seems,” “it’s likely that”)
– Add nuance, subtle critique, or alternative perspectives when appropriate
– Avoid overusing generic AI vocabulary like “investigate,” “robust,” “innovative,” etc.
– Use more natural transitions (and don’t overuse phrases like “therefore,” “moreover,” or “in conclusion”)
– Replace vague examples with specific, relatable, or realistic details
– Adjust the tone and style so it feels less polished and more human (a slightly informal tone is fine)
– If relevant, include first-person voice or a slightly anecdotal tone
– Break repetition at the beginning of sentences (for example, don’t start every sentence with “This study...” or “It is important...”)
– Preserve the original meaning and context, but enhance the naturalness and authenticity
