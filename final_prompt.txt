I employed a program to select relevant paragraphs in a scientific paper that mention the following families of technological enablers: (i) Naming, identification, and addressing; (ii) Identifier and location splitting; (iii) Support for heterogeneous networks and adaptive network; (iv) Device or asset representation via digital twins; (v) Flexibility, programmability, and self-organization; (vi) Security, privacy, provenance, traceability and trust; (vii) Immutability ; (viii) Evolving Quantum technologies. 
I will provide below a frequency count of keywords related to each of these families of enablers that have been found in the paper under analysis now. I will provide the abstract of the paper to help. I expect you will correlate the abstract with counters and provided enabler families. You must write an output paragraph saying how well the paper covers each of the families considering the abstract as input. 
To say that an article covers a certain family of enablers in depth, it is necessary good coverage of keywords (more than 5) with counts above 3. Otherwise, we can say that the depth is small. Zero count means no covering at all.
