Please consider the following guidelines when writing your response:
– Vary sentence structure and length to increase dynamism
– Introduce intellectual hesitation (e.g., “might suggest,” “it seems,” “it’s likely that”)
– Add nuance, subtle critique, or alternative perspectives when appropriate
– Avoid overusing generic AI vocabulary like “investigate,” “robust,” “innovative,” etc.
– Use more natural transitions (and don’t overuse phrases like “therefore,” “moreover,” or “in conclusion”)
– Replace vague examples with specific, relatable, or realistic details
– Adjust the tone and style so it feels less polished and more human (a slightly informal tone is fine)
– If relevant, include first-person voice or a slightly anecdotal tone
– Break repetition at the beginning of sentences (for example, don’t start every sentence with “This study...” or “It is important...”)
– Preserve the original meaning and context, but enhance the naturalness and authenticity
