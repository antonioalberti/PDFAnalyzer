Previous sentence: This led to models such as [3] 
which exhibit a high degree of phase field width independence.
Current sentence: None -
theless it is vital that the formulation used for the simulations is as 
efficient as possible and one of the aims of this paper is to improve ef-
ficiency in the anisotropy implementation.
Next sentence: The phase field simulation of complex crystal morphologies, uses the 
phase variable, ¤ò, and necessarily involves the inclusion of an anisotropy 
function, A┬àÔïê¤ò┬å, which reflects, at the mesoscopic scale, the underlying 
crystallography of the ordering at the atomic scale.

Previous sentence: On inspecting current ap-
proaches to modelling facets within phase field we observe that there are two distinct approaches: one imple -
ments the faceting purely in the kinetic parameter thus avoiding the complications of taking gradients of 
discontinuous functions; while the second is based upon regularisation of the anisotropy function within the free 
energy function.
Current sentence: Armed with our new insight into the operation of anisotropy within phase field we refine the 
second of these and advocate a vertex based approach to facet anisotropy modelling.
Next sentence: Results include regular and 
irregular morphologies and hill-valley growth.

Previous sentence: The latter, bulk modelling, is the more closely 
linked to thermodynamics, whereas surface modelling is completely 
divorced from bulk properties.
Current sentence: This paper concerns surface modelling.

field appear simultaneously through the introduction of an interface 
width, being a measure of the size of the transition region.

Previous sentence: A major contribution to 
the understanding of anisotropy in phase field is presented in [9] which 
associates a vector field (termed the ╬¥-vector) with the anisotropy and 
the resulting equilibrium crystal shape - the Wulff shape: [9] also de-
velops, to some extent, the method for implementing this in phase field.
Current sentence: We have a further look at this term from the perspective of a differential 
form in this paper.
Next sentence: We then inspect facet models.

Previous sentence: Once the normals to the facets are specified, then a surface energy can be 
formed that is a function of these normals and the direction of growth.
Current sentence: This approach is to be compared with the approach advocated in this 
paper, where it is the vertices of the polyhedra or polygons that form the 
basis of the surface energy construction.
Next sentence: Facet models in phase field tend to begin with an ÔÇ£ideal ÔÇØ anisotropy 
function that typically contain unappealing discontinuities which, in 
turn, will likely cause numerical instability ÔÇô see [17].

Current sentence: Some modellers stayed loyal to free energy implementation [15ÔÇô19], 
through the approach of regularisation.
Next sentence: The first two papers, produce 
faceting by increasing the strength of the anisotropy to produce a Wulff 
shape with pronounced cusps (ears), whereas the latter three papers 
work with anisotropy with formally flat sides, no cusps and rounded 
ÔÇÿvertices ÔÇÖ.
