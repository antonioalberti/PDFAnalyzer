Please note the distinction between h and ╬öx.
Current sentence: ╬öx is the grid distance 
between mesh points (assumed equal in x and y) but h, related to a 
typical maximum value of ÔÇáÔïê¤òÔÇá, can be chosen arbitrarily taking into 
account machine accuracy and how closely one wants the numerical 
scheme to follow the approximation to the max function.
Next sentence: A smaller h 
gives lower curvature on the facets.

Previous sentence: Simply setting this term to zero results in 
melting and so, by trial and error we find a temperature just low enough 
to give growth.
Current sentence: However, its evolution towards that end state is interesting in itself 
and can be compared with non-phase field models such as [34,35] , being 
discrete models for growth and dissolution respectively.
Next sentence: As is normal 
practice, the phase field simulation seeds the growth in a metastable 
energy state as a circle or sphere.
