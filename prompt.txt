As a scientist, you are interested in determining the presence or absence of eight technology enabler families structured as follows: (i) Naming, identification, and addressing; (ii) Identifier and location splitting; (iii) Support for heterogeneous networks and adaptive network; (iv) Device or asset representation via digital twins; (v) Flexibility, programmability, and self-organization; (vi) Security, privacy, provenance, traceability and trust; (vii) Immutability ; (viii) Evolving Quantum technologies. I will provide below a frequency count of keywords related to each of these families of enablers in a certain reference paper. Also, I will reproduce phrases where these keywords occur in an original scientific paper under analysis to help you. I expect you will correlate such phrases with counters and provided enabler families. To say that an article covers a certain family of enablers in depth, it is necessary good coverage of keywords (more than 5) with counts above 3. Otherwise, we can say that the depth is small. Zero count means no covering at all.
