Support for adequate naming, identification, and addressing of devices, equipment, and services in Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0: The paper shows no coverage of this enabler, as no related keywords were identified.

Support for identifier and location splitting (ID/Loc) in entities of Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0: There is no coverage of this enabler in the paper, given the absence of any relevant keyword mentions.

Support for heterogeneous and adaptive networking in Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0: The paper offers small coverage of this enabler, indicated only by the keyword "flexibility" appearing 6 times. Other keywords associated with this enabler are not present.

Support for device or physical asset representation using digital twins in Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0: This enabler is well covered in the paper, with "digital twin" mentioned 13 times and "digital twins" mentioned 10 times, clearly surpassing the threshold for good coverage.

Support for flexibility, programmability, and self-organization in Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0 architectures: The paper demonstrates small coverage of this area, with "flexibility" appearing 6 times, along with "middleware" (4) and "microservices" (2). Although multiple keywords appear, only "flexibility" meets the count threshold, indicating limited but present focus.

Support for security, privacy, provenance, traceability, and trust in Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0: There is small coverage here, as keywords such as "cybersecurity" (2), "authentication" (1), and "authorization" (1) appear but with low frequency and limited variety.

Support for immutability of data and program integrity in Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0 by using distributed ledger technologies: The paper exhibits very minimal coverage, with only one mention of "decentralized" and no other relevant keywords found.

Overall Summary: The paper primarily focuses on the digital twin enabler, providing good coverage in this area. Other enablers receive limited attention, mainly in flexibility-related aspects and security components, but most remain unaddressed or minimally discussed. There is no coverage of naming and addressing or identifier/location splitting enablers. The paper offers a focused exploration of digital twins with some peripheral coverage of flexibility and security, but lacks comprehensive treatment of other key technological enablers in Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0.
